# Skill/Product Exchange

## Abstract
This project idea solves a highly ignored problem where the medium of exchange is not fiscal money, but other goods and skills that the customers possess. Our trading platform is an application that provides an online platform that enables a barter/exchange system for consumers who are willing to trade products instead of fiscal money. In simple terms, the users who possess goods and skills can barter/exchange it with other consumers. Let us say a user is good at playing soccer and wants to learn driving can trade his soccer skills with another user who is willing to teach driving to him. This application provides the customers with a platform to display, share and acquire the goods and services, unlike the existing online platforms that only provide buying and selling products and services. Both users can create a profile with their specialties listed that they could teach and things they want to learn. Our application will aim to match pairs which can then be involved in products/skills exchange.
The aim of this project was to develop a cloud app which will be available as a service to users by using the GCP and AWS cloud resources to perform various operations or provide various features for the barter/exchange process.
The application will handle multiple requests concurrently. It will automatically scale out when the request demand increases, and automatically scale in when the demand drops. 

Further details are provided in the report.

## Instructions:
AWS Credentials are already in place in Constants.java file. An instance is already running in GCP for serving the requests. The website is available at this link (HTTP Requests should be sent to this link for load testing):
